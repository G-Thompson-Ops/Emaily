# Emaily

A demo app made using Node, Express and React following a Udemy course : https://www.udemy.com/course/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/

I highly recommend this course to anyone who has not had any exposure to development before (either client, server or full stack). This is the first self-learning course I have _ever_ found that has successfully introduced me into the world of programming.

Note there are a number of deviations from the course scattered throughout this application. This is due to self-learning and experimentation as I progressed through the course.

# Demo

You can demo this app's latest version (master branch) here: https://emaily-g-t-ops.herokuapp.com

Please note: The demo will _NOT_ work if you do not use HTTPS. This cannot be forced by Heroku on a free deployment.
